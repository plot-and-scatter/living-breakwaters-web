This estuary\n            habitat and its food web also support important fishes, including\n            for hundreds of millions of out-migrating juvenile salmon each year\n            that come from throughout the vast Fraser River watershed. The\n            region also provides key habitat for white sturgeon, one of the\n            largest freshwater fish in the world, and Pacific herring, which are\n            a foundational part of the coastal food web. Moreover, these fish\n            are tied to both Indigenous food sovereignty and ways of life. With\n            most of the existing coastline fixed behind hard infrastructures\n            (e.g., dikes and seawalls), coastal ecosystems in the region cannot\n            migrate with rising sea levels. A lack of sediment and other factors\n            further exacerbate this problem. Over the course of the 20th\n            century, dredging (for navigation) and the construction of many\n            jetties and breakwaters have significantly altered sedimentation\n            patterns.

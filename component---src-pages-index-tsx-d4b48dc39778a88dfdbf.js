At the same time, changes in seasonal weather patterns will increase the frequency and severity of extreme storm events which will in turn exacerbate the impact of SLR on coastal biophysical, social and economic systems. Canadaâ€™s coastline is the largest in the world measuring 243,042 km. In western Canada, in coastal cities such as Vancouver, municipal and city governments have already begun to utilize adaptation strategies to protect and enhance coastal ecosystems, and existing coastal infrastructure. These strategies include a suite of hard and soft conventional and unconventional approaches that are meant to reduce risk related to SLR by integrating coastal ecosystem adaptive capacity with nature-based ecosystem, and governance solutions."),s.a.createElement("p",null,"This report documents a wide range of approaches that incorporates strategies for coastal environmental design based on the idea of rebuilding or designing with nature.

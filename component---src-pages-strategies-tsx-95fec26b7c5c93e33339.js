Additionally, hard structures, e.g., dikes and seawalls create negative effects and feedback on ecosystem morphology and dynamics resulting in ecological communities due to habitat modification.

Therefore, adaptation solutions for coastal flooding ought to be developed taking into considerations a wide range of social and environmental conditions. These conditions when considered collectively present themes that may require different approaches to adaptation. For example, a nature-based solution (NBS) approach utilizing wetlands can be effective as wave attenuation during storm surges in order to protect people and coastal assets from erosion and storms. However, in areas where wetlands may not be viable, the most appropriate solution might be retreating from the shoreline or implementing other forms of hard defense, e.g., dikes or a mixture of grey and green coastal infrastructure solutions. In other areas, sediment fences may be used to reduce erosion and simulate sedimentation that can serve as precursor to the rehabilitation of wetlands or mangrove forests.

Flood defences, such as dikes, groynes, and jetties can also be aesthetically and visually obstructive or displeasing.

Perceptions of higher levels of risk can contribute a heightened sense of community thereby preparing littoral populations to be more responsive to adapt to coastal changes. Community buy in is also critical for ensuring favourable outcomes among diverse groups, to achieve win-win solutions and to prevent conflicts between competing coastal interests.

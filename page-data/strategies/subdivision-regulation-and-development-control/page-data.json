The standards work in tandem with existing development approvals and processes for inspection. The green standards apply to subdivision and site controls for new development related to zoning amendments. The Toronto green standards are useful tools for addressing climate change concerns in the city of Toronto. For example, the standards mandate that new developments retain no less than 5 mm of rainwater for reuse.

The terms and conditions for such negotiations are specified in local bylaws including consideration for a range of issues related to environmental protection.

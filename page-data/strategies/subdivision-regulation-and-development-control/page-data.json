The standards work in tandem with existing development approvals and processes for inspection. The green standards apply to subdivision and site controls for new development related to zoning amendments. The Toronto green standards are useful tools for addressing climate change concerns in the city of Toronto. For example, the standards mandate that new developments retain no less than 5 mm of rainwater for reuse. This helps to reduce stormwater runoff. <sup id=\"fnref-5\"><a href=\"#fn-5\" class=\"footnote-ref\">5</a></sup></p>","<h3>Halifax Regional Municipality development agreements</h3>\n<h4>Halifax Nova Scotia</h4>\n<p>In Halifax Nova Scotia, the Regional Municipality has included in the 2006 regional plan a provision for developments to be constructed with a minimum height that is above the ordinary high watermark. One of the other provisions of the plan is the inclusion of development agreements where areas are designated as zones require negotiations before development projects proceed. The terms and conditions for such negotiations are specified in local bylaws including consideration for a range of issues related to environmental protection. The process of negotiating a development agreement allows planners and developers to share information on wave activity and storm surges to inform resilient project designs. <sup id=\"fnref-5\"><a href=\"#fn-5\" class=\"footnote-ref\">5</a></sup></p>"],"summary":"<p>A subdivision regulation is a planning tool that can be used to establish conditions for the protection against environmental hazards, e.g., coastal hazards related to sea-level rise.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> A subdivision is defined as a separate title of land (bare land strata lot, strata unit, townhouse, row house, or a condominium unit).<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> The tool works in conjunction with zoning where the administrative responsibility of the subdivision of land is usually given to an Approving Officer who has the power to refuse or approve a subdivision plan.<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup> Subdivision regulation can be complementary to other development control measures.

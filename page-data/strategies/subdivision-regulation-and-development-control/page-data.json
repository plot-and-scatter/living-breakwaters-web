One of the other provisions of the plan is the inclusion of development agreements where areas are designated as zones require negotiations before development projects proceed. The terms and conditions for such negotiations are specified in local bylaws including consideration for a range of issues related to environmental protection. The process of negotiating a development agreement allows planners and developers to share information on wave activity and storm surges to inform resilient project designs. <sup id=\"fnref-5\"><a href=\"#fn-5\" class=\"footnote-ref\">5</a></sup></p>","<h3>Toronto’s Green Standard</h3>\n<h4>Toronto, Ontario, Canada</h4>\n<p>The Toronto green standards outline a set of measures to regulate the site and building design, energy and water efficiency, ecological services and solid waste management, and air and water quality. The standards work in tandem with existing development approvals and processes for inspection. The green standards apply to subdivision and site controls for new development related to zoning amendments. The Toronto green standards are useful tools for addressing climate change concerns in the city of Toronto. For example, the standards mandate that new developments retain no less than 5 mm of rainwater for reuse.

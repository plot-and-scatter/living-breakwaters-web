This gives us a very fast way of looking up a progress position rather than looping through all the points/Beziers.

This area is home to\n              68% of dairy operations and 80% of poultry operations in the\n              province. The region is also known for its cranberry production,\n              accounting for 92% of the cranberries in B.C. and 48% of all\n              cranberries in Canada. Moreover, B.C. has become the largest\n              producer of highbush blueberries in the world, with most of its\n              production concentrated in the Fraser River Delta.{' '}\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n              As part of the Agricultural Land Reserve, a land-protection\n              program adopted in 1973, agricultural land is protected from\n              encroaching urbanization and industry. However, a significant\n              percentage of agricultural land in the region is located within\n              floodplains. Increased flood risks and salination from rising sea\n              levels pose significant concerns to hundreds of farming operations\n              in the region. With less than 5% of the province’s land base\n              considered arable, developing flood protection measures as well as\n              testing alternative farming practices are critical to maintaining\n              the agricultural sector in the province.{' '}\n            </p>\n          </>\n        }\n        narrativeText={\n          <>\n            <p>\n              Coastal habitats adapt to environmental and climate change, e.g.,\n              sea-level rise by migrating inland to retain their relative\n              function and structure. Coastal squeeze occurs where coastal\n              armoring or other barriers prevent this natural migration creating\n              fixed margins between the land and sea.1, 2 Coastal squeeze may\n              lead to the loss of intertidal habitats or even entire intertidal\n              zones. The rate at which the loss takes place is dependent on\n              factors such as the geographical formation of the coast. 1{' '}\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n              Coastal armoring changes the natural dynamics of shoreline\n              sediment transport. In coastal and riverine areas, sustained\n              sediment supplies are important for maintaining shoreline position\n              and for offsetting surface subsidence. Surface subsidence is the\n              decline in surface elevation due to the loss of sediment deposits.\n              3 Trapped behind sea defense systems, wetlands, mangrove, and\n              marshes become increasingly vulnerable to accelerated surface\n              subsidence, erosion, and decline. 4\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n              Subsidence may also occur due to different forms of underground\n              failure.3,8 In many areas, large tracks of wetlands have been\n              converted to agricultural use. 5 that have been protected behind\n              coastal defense structures such as flood banks.6 Supporting such\n              agricultural enterprises has meat adopting irrigation practices\n              that involve extracting potable water from deep underground\n              aquifers. This leads to groundwater fluxes, saltwater intrusion,\n              and deep subsidence. 7 This process is manifested on the surface\n              of agricultural lands as tilting, sinking, and slumping of the\n              soil surface. Deep subsidence has also been attributed to tectonic\n              activity and deep basin processes that have destroyed agriculture\n              infrastructure. 8,9\n            </p>\n          </>\n        }\n        scenarioKey={'foodSecurity'}\n        activeNarrative={NarrativeType.FoodSecurity}\n        path={'food-security'}\n      />\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default FoodSecurity\n\nexport const pageQuery = graphql`\n  query {\n    site {\n      siteMetadata {\n        title\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`\n","// 22.1.3.6 Array.prototype.fill(value, start = 0, end = this.length)\nvar $export = require('./_export');\n\n$export($export.P, 'Array', { fill: require('./_array-fill') });\n\nrequire('./_add-to-unscopables')('fill');\n","import React from 'react'\n\nimport { useNarrative } from '../../NarrativeContext'\nimport PlaceableSVGProps from '../../../../@types/PlaceableSVGProps'\nimport Textbox from '../../PlaceableSVGs/Textbox'\nimport House1 from '../../PlaceableSVGs/Buildings/House1'\nimport Basement from '../../PlaceableSVGs/Buildings/Basement'\n\nexport const contentMap = {}\n\nconst BasementPop = (props: PlaceableSVGProps): JSX.Element => {\n  const { narrativeStage } = useNarrative()\n\n  const extraClasses = narrativeStage > 0 ?

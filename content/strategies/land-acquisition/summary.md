Land acquisition is the process of purchasing or expropriating land with the primary purpose of protecting the public interest.[^1] For example, land may be acquired to prevent development to hold it in public ownership for environmental protection purposes.[^1] As a sea-level rise adaptation strategy, land acquisition provides protection against the development of land that can contribute to coastal protection. For example, land can be acquired to protect beaches and sand dunes that protect shorelines against erosion and extreme storm events. [^8] The process for land acquisition could be stymied by a lack of political and financial support because the expropriation of land can be contentious and expensive.[^2]

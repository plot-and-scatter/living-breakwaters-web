### Blue Acres Buyout Program 
#### NJ, USA

In 2013, the Superstorm Sandy Blue Acres Program was launched as a response to the catastrophic damage caused by Hurricane Sandy. Under the program, 1,300 properties in tidal areas and towns that are prone to flooding were purchased for $300 million.[^4] The properties that were purchased were demolished to allow space for natural buffers and future recreational activities, conservation, and flood protection.[^5] The program is currently active in 14 municipalities and work continues with local officials to expand the program to other coastal communities.[^6]

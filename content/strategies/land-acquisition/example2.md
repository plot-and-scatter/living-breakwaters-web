### Bas-Saint-Laurent Land Acquisition 
#### Bas-Saint-Laurent QB, Canada

In 2010, the Province of Quebec acquired and relocated 100 homes that were destroyed in a storm. The acquired properties were then sold to the Bas-Saint-Laurent municipality as a way of gaining control of the land and preventing future development.[^7] As a response to the relocation of the people, the municipality created new residential development further inland. A total of $5.5 million was provided by the provincial government of Quebec to support the relocation program.[^8]

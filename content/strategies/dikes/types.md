- **Superdikes** have a high embankment, a wide base, and a gentle slope. They are usually larger than a standard dike and are designed to withstand earthquakes, erosion, and breaches. Super dikes are designed for water to flow slowly during overtopping. They are also designed to function in low lying urban areas. Hence, they are multifunctional in that they incorporate protection measures for residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. [^10]
- **A double dike:** the essential feature of a double dike is that the primary dike is not raised thus allowing water to flow over during storm-like weather. A second dike further inland is designed to contain the flow of water over the first dike. [^11]
- **A triple dike** has a 3-zone defense structure, a front, central and back zone. The central zone acts as a multifunctional dike. The back zone manages water and rainwater runoff while the front zone decreases the impact of waves. [^12]
- **“The bionic dike** is a concept proposal to reinterpret water safety as 100 percent adaptive.” In this concept the dike has no rigid height, instead, the dike landscape adjusts to environmental changes over time. Developed for the city of In Wageningen the dike is designed to move with the water. When the tide is low the dike opens, when the tide is high the water pressure causes the dike to rise thereby protecting the city. [^13]

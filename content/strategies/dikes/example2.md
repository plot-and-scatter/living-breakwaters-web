### Richmond Dike System 
#### Richmond BC, Canada

The City of Flood Protection Management Strategy and Dike Master Plans serve as a guiding framework for continual upgrades and improvements to address climate change-induced sea-level rise. The Richmond Dike System was originally constructed in 1860 and surrounds the Lulu and Sea Islands.[^7] The dike system is an important feature of the settlement of Richmond where it was utilized to protect residential, agricultural, and industrial lands from inundation.[^8] The dikes have also become a landmark with the integration of recreational trails, vegetation, and structural elements (docks and bridges) known today as the West and South Dyke Trail.[^9] Although these trails offer beautiful views of British Columbiaâ€™s coastal landscape, the structural integrity of the current dike system might be affected by climate change and sea-level rise. In response, the City of Richmond is exploring current plans to upgrade the dike system.

- Prevents flooding in low lying coastal areas
- The sloped seaward edge of the dike reduces wave loading and improves wave energy dissipation 
- Protects of value development against coastal flooding 
- Reduces the effects of coastal erosion by reducing wave energy. 
- Reduced toe scour given that the down rush of the wave is directed away from the structure. This reduces the risks associated with undermining.

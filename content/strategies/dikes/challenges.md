- Expensive to construct and requires high maintenance
- Structural integrity decreases over time due to storm damage
- Require large volumes of building materials. 
- Requires a large area of land to facilitate the shallow slopes that are needed to aid in wave dissipation. 
- Results in fixing the position of the coastline thereby disrupting natural geomorphological processes [^14]

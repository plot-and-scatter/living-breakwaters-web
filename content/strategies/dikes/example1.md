### Delta Works
#### The Netherlands

Delta Works is a series of flood protection construction projects that were implemented along the Dutch coast in response to the devastating flood of 1953.[^4] Part of the engineering works was the construction and reinforcement of numerous dikes and levees that have completely changed the Dutch landscape and have become a cultural and historical part of the landscape.[^5] With the increase in research on climate change and sea-level rise, the Delta committee has initiated long-term plans for the reinforcement of the current flood protection structures. The plan incorporates two approaches: ‘building with nature’ and ‘room for the river’.[^6] This can be seen in the recent projects: The Sand Engine and The Hondsbossche Dunes, which are intended to reinforce the existing dikes through the concept of working with natural coastal dynamics. Given its scope and significance, Delta Works was designated by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World.

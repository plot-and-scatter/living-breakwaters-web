Dikes are linear compacted earth structures implemented to protect coastal areas from flooding.[^1] Because dikes are built with a high volume of compacted earth, they are efficient in resisting high water pressure, wave loadings, and overtopping.[^2] Traditionally, dike construction consists of a sand core, an outer watertight protection layer, toe protection, and a back drainage channel.[^3] These structures are unique in their typologies and can be designed to enhance the economic, recreational, and ecological value of the coastline. Currently, research is being conducted on how dikes can be more successfully integrated within the landscape and potentially increase the multifunctionality and robustness of dikes while reducing breaches.

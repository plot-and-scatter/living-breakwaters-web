Dry floodproofing is a practice of utilizing waterproof membranes and other types of sealants to prevent floodwater from entering a building.[^1] It may also include the installation of watertight seals over windows and doors, diversion of water using berms and mounds, or the establishment of minimum setback regulations for building construction. [^3] [^5] [^6] [^7] [^11] The work required to dry flood-proof a structure could be determined through a risk assessment following local government requirements, guidelines, or policies.[^2] [^3] Depending on the complexity of the requirements, dry floodproofing is usually a cost-effective retrofit. Dry floodproofing contributes to a reduction in potential flood damage by decreasing the probability of inundation to the interior of a building. Dry floodproofing is a useful alternative as a flood mitigation measure where the relocation or elevation of a building is not a plausible cost-effective or technically feasible alternative. [^12]

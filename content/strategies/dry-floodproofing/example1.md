### HafenCity 
#### Hamburg, Germany

HafenCity is an example of flood adaptation as an alternative to dike construction. The town wanted to retain the beautiful sightlines down to the water, therefore, a dike was not the best option.[^4] Instead, all new buildings were raised on plinths 8 to 9 meters above sea level.[^5] Plinths are artificial mounds that are built using compacted fill, and the interior function as spaces for underground parking. In addition to raising buildings, the roads and bridges of HafenCity are also built roughly eight (8) meters above sea level, therefore allowing the town to function seamlessly during a storm surge.[^6]

### FLOAT House 
#### New Orleans LA, USA

The Float House is a prototype for housing that adapts to coastal flooding. It is used in coastal areas that are susceptible to flooding. The design features an adaptable frame that acts as a raft. Guided steel masts allow the house to float up to as high as 12 feet.[^1] Not only does the float boat adapt to floods it also produces its own energy.[^2] The float boat project is a great example of sea-level rise adaptation through research and design.

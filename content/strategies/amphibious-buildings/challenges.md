- Barriers erode naturally over time due to longshore redistribution of sediments[^11]
- Large volumes of sand are required to renourish eroding barriers
- Barriers develop from unconsolidated sediments and are therefore highly unstable and unsuitable for built development
- Erosion of barriers leads to changes in sheltered wetlands including changes in salinity, tidal range, and sediment load[^11]
- Preservation becomes increasingly difficult where there exist high levels of shoreline and bathymetric changes[^11]

Amphibious architecture is an adaptation strategy where structures are designed to adapt to flooding.  In this way, a structure is less susceptible to inundation.  Some amphibious buildings are built on elevated foundations. Other buildings are constructed on foundations that under normal circumstances rest firmly on a solid surface. However, during periods of flooding, the building floats. Amphibious buildings with the capacity to float are supported by a buoyancy system that allows the base of a building to move as the water level changes. Therefore, amphibious architecture is ideally suited to flood-prone regions with natural cycles of flooding.[^3]

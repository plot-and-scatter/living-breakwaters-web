- **Dry roof structures** prevent water from entering a building during a flood. These structures incorporate internal or external flood protection barriers [^7]
- **Wet roof structures** allow floodwaters to flow into and remain in a building during a flood and flow out of the building when the floodwater begins to subside. Wet roof structures are constructed with materials that can withstand flood damage. Hence, wet roof structures are designed to mimic natural landscapes such as floodplains [^7]
- **Permanent static elevations** are structures that are permanently elevated as an adaptation measure to flooding. They are usually located in areas where flooding occurs regularly [^6]
- **Buoyant foundations** allow a building to sit on a regular foundation during dry weather but float during a flood. Buoyancy foundations consist of three basic elements, buoyancy blocks that allow the building to float, vertical guideposts that control the movement of the structure up and down, and a subframe that holds the platform and building together [^4] [^5]

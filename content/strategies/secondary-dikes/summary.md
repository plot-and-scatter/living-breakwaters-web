Secondary dikes work in conjunction with primary dikes to reduce the impact of a flood if the primary dike is breached.[^1] Several secondary dikes designs may be similar to that of a primary dike but on a smaller scale. For example, in the city of Winnipeg, and secondary dike is simply defined as **(any permanent dyke or other flood control work within the City of Winnipeg which has been, or is, constructed between a primary dyke and the channel)**. Hence, secondary dikes are classified based on their position and the role they play in flood mitigation. In the Netherlands, secondary dikes were historically known as ‘sleeper dikes’: a backup dike which is located between the main dike and the land.[^2] Today, secondary dikes are still a viable adaptation strategy and are usually placed behind the main dike to protect high-value residential land in the case of a breach. In between the main dike and secondary dike are the least sensitive assets such as parks and open spaces that can withstand flooding.

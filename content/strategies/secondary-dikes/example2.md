### Terra Nova Secondary Dike
#### Richmond BC, Canada

As part of the Richmond Dike Master Plan, the City of Richmond British Columbia is considering an alternative dike alignment in the Terra Nova area. As an alternative, the Dike Master Plan identifies the alignment to be set inland as part of a secondary dike. The dike is intended to protect sensitive assets such as private homes and heritage sites while less sensitive assets such as parks, trails, and open spaces can be flooded, in the case of a breach.[^6]

### Hawaiian Island Land Trust 
#### Hawaii, USA

The Hawaiian Island Land Trust (HILT) was established to protect ecologically sensitive landscapes. In 2004, HILT acquired the ownership of the 277 acres Waiheâ€™e Coastal Dunes and Wetland Refuge.[^4] The program was established to restore and enhance critical ecosystems while preserving historical and cultural resources.[^5], [^6] These ecosystems will be inundated in the future by sea-level rise. Thus, the program aims to restore the landscape to what it was in the past.[^7] With the help of volunteers, over 70% of native species have returned to the landscape.[^8]

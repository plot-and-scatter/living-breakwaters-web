- **Detached breakwater** systems are constructed without any direct connection to the shore. These systems are designed to promote sediment deposition on their leeside. They are appropriate in coastlines that are prone to significant sediment transport. 
- **Headland breakwater** systems are constructed as a series of breakwater structures that are attached to the shoreline. Each structure is set at an angle. This helps to break up predominant wave patterns. Behind these structures, the shoreline evolves as a log spiral embayment.
- **Nearshore breakwaters** are detached systems that are parallel to the shoreline. They are designed to slow down littoral drift but they produce sediment deposition and shoreline bulge. 
- **Rubble mound breakwaters** are constructed using an armor layer, filter layer, and a core. They are built from quarry run rock that is overlaid by large boulders. Wave action is reduced by constructing crown walls at the top of the structure. [^14]

Breakwaters are linear, offshore, or onshore structures built to protect the coast from the effects of both storm surges and longshore drift. There are many types of breakwaters including emergent, submergent, offshore, or those connected to the shore. A breakwater can be a single continuous structure or several detached structures.[^1] A breakwater is usually constructed by stacking large rocks or concrete units in a revetment slope.[^2] Recently, concrete unit designs have been incorporating ecological functions that enhance habitat sustainability. Such designs have used textured patterns that allow reef systems to thrive.

### Living Breakwaters
#### Staten Island NY, USA [^5]

Living Breakwaters is a Rebuild by Design winning proposal for the design of Staten Islandâ€™s south shore. The design concept seeks to reduce risk by building breakwater structures that are ecological resilience. This is achieved using a necklace of offshore breakwaters.[^3] The design of these unique breakwaters distinguishes them from other breakwater systems. The design also features a mix of sub-tidal beds, forms, and micro-pockets that serve as habitat for different marine species. The breakwaters create a calm environment behind them that promotes water-based activities and land-based activities.[^4] The project has received $60 million in funding.[^5]

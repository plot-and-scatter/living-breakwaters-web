Development permits regulate land use to ensure that areas are developed in a manner that aligns with environmental protection and the protection of ecosystems, biodiversity. [^12] Development permits may also be used to protect a development from hazardous conditions. A Development Permit Area (DPA) may restrict development in areas except for any conditions also included in the permit.[^1] A DPA may also identify lands that are prone to coastal hazards so that these hazards can be addressed before the development of the land.[^2] Implementation of a development permit requires the designation of a DPA by the Official Community Plan which includes an amending bylaw and public hearing and approval by the local government.[^3] Challenges can occur if the background studies of hazards and environmentally sensitive areas are not well justified.[^4]

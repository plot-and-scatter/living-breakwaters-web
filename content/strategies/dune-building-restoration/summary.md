Dunes develop from sand deposits that represent a store of sediment in the zone just landward of normal high tides. Dune building or restoration is the process of stabilizing existing coastal dunes through coastal management practices such as planting dune vegetation and using sand fences. During storm surges, coastal sand dunes act as a resilient barrier against the disruptive forces of wind and wave action and help reduce the amount of erosion by supplying sand to eroded beaches during storms.[^1] They also provide habitat for rare and endangered species.[^2]

### British Columbia’s Pacific Rim National Park Reserve 

Located along the beaches of British Columbia’s Pacific Rim National Park Reserve are some of Canada’s rarest sand dune ecosystems.[^4] However, the Wickaninish Beach dune ecosystem are being affected by invasive species (European and American Beachgrass), which prevents dynamic sand movement and allows forest land to expand upon the dunes.[^5] The native plant species have roots that are critical to the structural integrity of the dunes and prevents wave erosion. In 2008, Parks Canada started an ambitious five-year restoration project to restore the Pacific Rim sand dune ecosystem with the primary goal of removing invasive plant species. Monitoring programs show that in 2010 alone over 1 hectare of invasive species was removed and currently over 60% of the dune ecosystem is restored.[^6]

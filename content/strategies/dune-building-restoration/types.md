- **Blowouts** usually exist within older vegetated dunes in the foredunes. They are landforms of erosional dunes that are usually depressions shaped like a trough, bowl, or saucer. Blowouts may also occur as hollows from wind erosion from an existing sandy substrate or dune.
- **Parabolic dunes** develop from the continuous transport of sand through a blowout. They are composed of two trailing arms that enclose a deflation basin, an actively advancing nose, and depositional lobe. This process leads to the development of a U-shape (i.e., parabolic) or V-shaped dune.
- **Transgressive sand sheets and dune fields** are relatively large aeolian deposits of sand that are formed as a result of downwind movement of sand across a vegetated to semi-vegetated terrain. Transgressive sheets are primarily flat to undulating duneless sheets, whereas transgressive dune fields comprise various types of dunes on the surface 
- **Foredunes** develop on the landward side of an active beach at the rear part of the backshore. Generally, foredunes consist of convex, symmetrical to asymmetrical dune ridges parallel to the sore. Although the morphology of foredunes vary they may be placed into three main categories, namely: incipient foredunes, established foredunes, and relict foredunes [^7] [^8]

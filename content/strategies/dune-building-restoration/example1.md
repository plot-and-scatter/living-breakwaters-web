### Hondsbossche Dunes 
#### Noord Holland, The Netherlands

In 2015, the Hondsbossche and Pettemer sea dike was reinforced with 30 million cubic meters of sand in a foreshore and beach nourishment. The project was intended to improve flood safety and spatial quality.[^3]  Beach grass and sand fences were used to build an artificial dune landscape. The idea was that the dunes will bolster the protection of the beach from storm surges but also evolve overtime from wind and wave action.

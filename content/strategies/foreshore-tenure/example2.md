### West Vancouver Head Lease 
#### Vancouver BC, Canada

The West Vancouver Head Lease has been held by the District of West Vancouver and the Province of B.C. since 1974. The lease covers the management of land under the high water level.[^4] The head lease extends 1,000 meters into the Burrard Inlet except for the areas controlled by the Vancouver Port Authority and the B.C. Ferries Terminal.[^5] The lease facilitates the establishment of public infrastructure (walkways, seawalls, boat ramps, piers, wharves, and marinas) and natural enhancements (groynes, rock reefs, rip-rap).[^6] Also, the head lease is accompanied by the adoption of an Official Community Plan and a 5-year foreshore protection plan to protect the foreshore.[^7]

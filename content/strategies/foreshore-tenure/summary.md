In British Columbia, the foreshore is defined as the land that exists between the low and high watermarks of a stream, river, lake, or ocean. [^9] Foreshore tenure is a legal instrument that authorizes the use of intertidal and subtidal areas. Foreshore tenure can work in conjunction with zoning to provide a more comprehensive approach to shoreline management[^1] that includes beach nourishment, dune or wetland creation, and/or rehabilitation. Foreshore tenures are generally authorized by the provincial government with some exceptions to the Canadian Marine Act which applies to harbors.[^2] Challenges may occur if targeted areas are unsuitable because of environmental, bathymetric, and other constraints.[^3]   In British Columbia, Land and Water BC is the agency charged with the responsibility to grant land act tenures including, licenses, leases, easements, and permits.

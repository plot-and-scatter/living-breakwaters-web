- A **Lease** is issued where substantial improvements are to be made to land, or where it is necessary to establish boundaries to avoid conflicts with neighboring owners. Foreshore leases have a standard term of 30 years. [^9] [^13]
- **Crown grant or fee simple disposition** refers to instances where crown land is converted to private ownership. In such instances, the crown does not give up its right to the foreshore or beds of contiguous bodies of water by a grant of fee simple. Such lands are retained for the public trust. 
- **Statutory rights of way over riparian rights of waterfront property** exist where the crown acquires a statutory right of way that is superior to the riparian rights of a waterfront parcel. This allows the crown to hold the rights to a waterfront parcel. 
- **Temporary permits** are intended for the occupation of aquatic crown land and may be issued for an investigation to be conducted before the authorization of a temporary use. Temporary permits are usually issued for commercial or industrial operations in the foreshore [^13]

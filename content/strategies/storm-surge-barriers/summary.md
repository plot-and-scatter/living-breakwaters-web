Storm surge barriers are heavily engineered movable or fixed barriers/gates that are closed to prevent flooding during bad weather forecasts.[^1] They are commonly located across the mouth of a tidal inlet or estuaries to control the water level and prevent excessive amounts of  water from entering the estuary.[^2] Storm surge barriers can be very beneficial for secondary flood protection,  on the landward side of the barrier. For example, storm surge barriers can reduce the maintenance and construction cost of secondary storm protection structures.[^3] Because these barriers require a high level of engineering feasibility studies and because they incur high construction costs, they can be challenging to implement as a cost-effective adaptation strategy. Additionally, storm surge barriers are more appropriate in areas with tidal lets that can be closed.[^4]

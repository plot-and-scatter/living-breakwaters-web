### Thames Barrier
#### London ENG, UK

The Thames Barrier is one of the largest movable storm surge barriers in the world. It was constructed in response to the frequent tidal surges that London experienced before the Flood Protection Act of 1972.[^5] Construction began in 1974 and the finished structure was put into operation in 1982.[^6] According to the Environment Agency, the Thames Barrier cost around Â£535 million to construct. The Thames Barrier is built to provide a high level of protection for several decades. In 2000-2001 there was an unusual number of closures. Then, it was projected that the trend will continue because of climate change and sea-level rise.[^7]

Early warning systems form an important element of disaster risk management. Compared to systems for flood forecasting, that assess risk, early warning systems sends out a warning either when a community is at risk from imminent flooding or when a flood event is already affecting a community. There are four key elements of an early warning system for floods; these include a) assessments of flood risks, b) monitoring of local hazards (forecasts) and warning service, c) dissemination of flood risk information, and d) building community response capabilities. [^12] Warning systems can be incorporated into most existing communication infrastructures. This strategy is particularly valuable where protection through large scale, hard defenses, is not acquirable.[^1] Warning systems require constant monitoring and risk assessment.[^2] They are generally low-cost and have proven to be successful in numerous developed or developing countries.[^3]

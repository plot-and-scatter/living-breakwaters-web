### River Forecast Centre
#### BC, Canada

The River Forecast Centre is a live interactive platform used by the province of British Columbia to provide information on seasonal water supply and flood risk, and river and streams flow predictions within the region.[^8] The interactive platform allows emergency managers and the public to prepare and/or respond to bulletins, maps, and flood warnings.[^9] Flood warnings and advisory maps identify current and future conditions in major basins and sub-basins at different advisory and warning levels. The center also provides high streamflow advisories, flood watch, and flood warnings.[^10]

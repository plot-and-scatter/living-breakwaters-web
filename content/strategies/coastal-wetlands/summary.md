Coastal wetlands represent ecosystems that are permanently or seasonally inundated with either fresh, brackish, or saline water that is usually less than 6 feet in depth at low tide. [^8] [^9] There are different types of coastal wetlands: salt marshes, fresh marshes, mangroves, and sea/eel grasses. In the United States, coastal wetlands cover about 40 million acres and makeup 38 percent of the total wetland acreage.[^1] The ecosystem services provided by coastal wetlands are essential to people and the environment. Services that are provided can include flood protection, erosion control, habitat and, fisheries preservation, water quality abatement, recreation, and carbon sequestration.[^2]

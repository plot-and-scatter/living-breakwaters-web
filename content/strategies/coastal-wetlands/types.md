- **Tidal salt marshes** are usually found in areas where the accumulation of sediment occurs at the same or higher rate than land subsidence. They are important for supporting the spawning and feeding of several marine organisms. Hence, they represent a critical interface between the land and sea.
- **Mangroves swamps** are estimated to occupy between 16 and 18 million hectares of coastal areas globally. In tropical and subtropical areas, mangrove swamps replace salt marshes. In some instances, both mangrove swamps and salt marshes exist together.  
- **Tidal freshwater marshes** are located close to tidal zones, but out of the reach of oceanic salt water. They comprise several features including salt marshes and freshwater marshes. Tidal freshwater marshes possess similar structural and functional characteristics as salt marshes. However, tidal freshwater marshes are more diverse because of reduced salt stress. 
- **Riparian wetlands** are ecotones or interfaces that exist between aquatic and upland ecosystems.  They possess distinctive vegetative and soil characteristics. Riparian wetlands are difficult to distinguish from surrounding landscapes therefore they are classified as mosaics of landforms and communities within a larger landscape. [^10]

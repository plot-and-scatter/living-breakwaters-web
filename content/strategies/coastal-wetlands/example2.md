### New Brighton Park Shoreline Restoration 
#### Vancouver BC, Canada

The New Brighton Park Shoreline Restoration is a collaborative project between the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority, Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation, and first nation groups to implement a design that supports the Park Boardâ€™s Strategic Plan, Rewilding Action Plan, and the Biodiversity Strategy.[^6] The project features a constructed tidal wetland that provides habitat for juvenile salmon as they migrate along the Burrard Inlet. The wetland also enhances the ecological function of the site by providing a resting and feeding habitat for shorebirds.[^7] The project is an excellent example of how a small-scale project can be a positive benefit to the overall ecological function of a site.

### Bluebelt Program 
#### Staten Island NY, USA

Bluebelt is a cost-effective and ecologically sound drainage system that captures runoff from streets and sidewalks. The program is designed to protect and enhance natural drainage channels, e.g., stream, ponds, and wetland to convey, store or filter runoff from precipitation and stormwater. [^8]
[^3] The design and construction of the Bluebelt began in the 1980s when the septic system in Staten Island was failing. During that time, planners recognized the importance of storm management and began acquiring land (wetlands, streams, and ponds) for the Bluebelt program.[^4] Since the 1980s, several watersheds were reclaimed and the Bluebelt has expanded greatly while improving the drinking water of the City.[^5]

### Windsor Flood Evacuation Route
#### Windsor SYD, Australia

In 2003, the development of a new flood evacuation route was proposed by the Roads and Traffic Authority of Syndey northwest.[^1] The proposed design included a 2.6 km elevated roadway that is 12 meters above the floodplain that stretches across the South Creek.[^2] The project was designed to address the challenges related to environmental sensitivities, soil type, and erosion.[^3] The evacuation route was officially opened in 2007 and now provides egress during flood events and relief for traffic congestion on Windsor Road.[^4]

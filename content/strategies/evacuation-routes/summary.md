Evacuation routes are accessways that are constructed above flood levels and that connect flood risk areas to mainland areas that are safely above flood plains. Evacuation routes can be integrated with a transportation network by constructing a new elevated road or by designating a lane on an existing road as an evacuation route. Evacuation routes are included in the flood protection management plans of communities that are vulnerable to flooding.  Evacuation routes are equipped with the appropriate signage that conveys the importance of flood control and the potential for flooding within a community. Ultimately, the effectiveness of evacuation routes is dependent on the allocation of resources towards maintaining an efficient road network and the type of evacuation that is triggered by a flood event.

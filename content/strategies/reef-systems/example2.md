### Souris Offshore Reefs
#### Souris PE, Canada

In 2017, two artificial reefs were installed along the Souris causeway to protect it from the impacts of climate change and the effects of storm surges.[^8] Two reefs were constructed using local sandstone which cost a total of $115,000.[^9] The reef function in two ways: it reduces the impact of waves and deposits sediment landward of the reefs. The accretion of sediment allows builds up the beach profile and compensates for the loss of sediment caused by erosion. [^14] Given its success, the Prince Edward Island government is considering expanding the project in other areas of the island as a response to the frequency of intense storm surges.[^10]

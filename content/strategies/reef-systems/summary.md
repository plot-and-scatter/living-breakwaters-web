Reefs are under and near water ecosystems that provide protection against flooding and erosion. There are different types of reefs, however, they all share similar ecosystem functions. For example, oyster reefs are a vital resource for supporting offshore pelagic fisheries and the fishing industry. Coral reefs are also crucial for the protection and stabilization of coastal geomorphological conditions.[^1] In terms of shoreline protection, reefs help stabilize bottom sediments, reduce wave energy, and prevent erosion. They are also important for the fortification of the worldâ€™s coastal wetlands such as the ones in the Gulf Coast.[^2] Recently, research has focused on how reef systems could be incorporated into the construction methods of other flood protection structures such as breakwaters and seawalls.

- **Fringing reefs** grow around islands and continents near coastlines. They have submerged planforms of live corals that extend from the shore seawards just under the surface of the water. Fringing reefs comprise two components a reef flat and a reef slope. Fringing reefs are the most common type of coral reef system. 
- **Barrier reefs** occur parallel to coastlines and are separated by deeper, wider lagoons. The reef creates a barrier between the coastline and the open sea. Barrier reefs may sometimes consist of assemblages of smaller reefs separated by a narrow strip of water, e.g., the Great Barrier reef. 
- **Atolls** are coral rings primarily located in the mid-ocean that create protected lagoons. Atolls are formed when coral grows on the side of an underwater volcano that terminates above the sea surface. The peak of the volcano erodes gradually and overtime is submerged below the sea surface. The reef may eventually re-emerge as a ring of island or islets. [^11]

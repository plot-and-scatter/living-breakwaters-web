Transfer of Development Rights (TDR), also commonly referred to as Transfer of Development Credits (TDC), is a mechanism that is used to encourage high-density development on lands that are less susceptible to the impacts of built infrastructure within a defined region, while limiting development on ecologically sensitive lands. This is known as density transfer. Density transfer is generally a voluntary market-based concept that could be used to protect coastal resources.[^1] Density transfer is appropriate where development potential is measurable and can be typically applied to residential uses.[^2]

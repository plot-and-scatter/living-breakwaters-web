### King County’s TDR Program 
#### Kings County WA, USA

A transfer of development rights (TDR) program was adopted by King County in 2001 to preserve important resources such as environmentally sensitive areas, wildlife habitat, open space, and shoreline access.[^6] The program was initially designed to reduce urban sprawl by designating ‘urban separators in between the urbanized west and the rural/forested east.[^7] The sending areas were typically low-density urban separator areas, agricultural land, rural areas, and forest production districts while receiving areas were typically urban areas with some limitations for use.[^8] As of 2007, the program preserved more than 90,000 acres of land through the 48 private market transactions of 455 TDR’s.[^9]

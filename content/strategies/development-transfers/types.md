- **Zoning lot mergers** involve two or more lots adjacent to each other that can be grouped as one lot for the purpose of zoning. This practice is commonly referred to as “as of right” that is, city approval is not a requirement, providing that landowners adhere to prescribed procedural guidelines. 
- **Landmark transfers** involve the designation of a building as a landmark. This prohibits any vertical additions or substantial architectural changes to the building. Landmark transfer rights can be sold to adjacent lots as well as lots across an intersection. 
- **Special purpose district transfers** involve the preservation of an area because of its unique characteristics. In special purpose districts, development rights that are unused may be transferred to adjacent buildings as well as any property within a designated zone. [^12]

- **Gravity Floodwalls:** a gravity floodwall derives structural stability from its weight. This is attained by effectively organizing the mass of the wall from the base, to support the weight of the materials at top of the wall. Gravity flood walls are easy to construct however they require a large quantity of materials.
- **Buttress and Counterfort Floodwalls** differ based on the position of their transverse support wall. The transverse support wall is on the heel side of a buttressed wall, opposite to any retained materials. In the case of a counterfort wall, the transverse support wall is on the toe side. 
- **Cantilever floodwalls** Constructed mostly using concrete, cantilever floodwalls utilize a cantilever action to restrict any mass behind the wall. It is the most common floodwall because it is economical to design and construct. [^10]

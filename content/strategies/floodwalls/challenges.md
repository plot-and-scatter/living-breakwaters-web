- Can lead to unintended consequences on local ecosystems and water flows. For example, flood walls may increase water flow in other areas. 
- Might be breached or toppled during an extreme flood event; increasing the damage from floodwaters. 
- Overtopping can cause scouring and loss of structural support on the passive side 
- During a flood event, a flood side gap may be formed resulting in a fully hydrostatic head along the wall face to the depth of the crack [^11] [^12]

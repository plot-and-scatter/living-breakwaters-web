Floodwalls are typically vertical structural barriers that are used in locations where space is limited due to buildings or other land uses.[^1] The size of floodwalls can vary from 1 ft to over 20 ft in height. They are usually constructed around buildings or other infrastructure that are below flood levels.[^2] Floodwalls can be more visually appealing compared to other protection structures. Additionally, they can be constructed using a variety of materials and methods to fit with the surrounding landscape and architectural character. Ultimately, the effectiveness of a floodwall is determined by the size of the storms and the technical characteristic of the wall.

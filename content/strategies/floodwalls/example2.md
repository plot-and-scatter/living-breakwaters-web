### Britannia Shipyard Floodwall 
#### Richmond BC, Canada

As a response to the large flood of 2016, the City of Richmond constructed a 250-meter-long, 2.9-meter-high floodwall for the Britannia Shipyards; a historical site that falls outside the existing dike system.[^6] The wall is made up of a vinyl sheet pile with wooden cladding and sections that are open to allow walkway access into the site.[^7] During a storm surge, the sections are closed off by aluminum flood panels to ensure the complete length of the wall is water-tight.[^8] The floodwall is part of Richmondâ€™s $300 million Dike Master Plan to reinforce the existing Richmond Dike System over 80 years.[^9]

### Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park
#### Bolivia

During the mid-1990s, the indigenous IsoseñoGuaraní people in Bolivia proposed the establishment of the Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park (KINP). The park occupies 3.4 million acres of land and is located in a lowly populated area in the eastern region of Bolivia that had been traditionally used for farming. However, industrialization had led to a rapid expansion in commercial agriculture and petroleum extraction in the region. Therefore, the park was created as a buffer around the territory of the IsoseñoGuaraní people. The legislation that established the park allowed for the extraction of resources from three designated zones. It also provided for the development of a management plan, which identified core protected areas within which resources could not be extracted and for special uses. The status of the park is preserved under a communal title that ensures that there is no subdivision or sale of land with the protected area. [^8]

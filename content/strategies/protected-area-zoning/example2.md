### Ontario Greenbelt 
#### Ontario, Canada

Commonly referred to as the Greater Golden Horseshoe (GGH), the Ontario greenbelt is one of the most dynamic and rapidly expanding regions in North America. The region supports two-thirds of Ontario’s population and more than one-quarter of the entire population of Canada. Located in the heart of the great lakes, the GGH contains some of Canada’s ecological and hydrologically sensitive environmental and scenic landscapes, including, productive farmland, and an abundant water supply. In 2005, Ontario developed the Greater Golden Horseshoe Growth Plan. The plan helps to determine where and how future growth should occur within the region, particularly what should be protected for future generations. The plan identifies protected countryside lands within the greenbelt that are intended to enhance the spatial parameters of agriculture and environmentally protected lands while improving linkages between protected areas, surrounding lakes, and watersheds.

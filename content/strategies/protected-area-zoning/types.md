- **Strict nature reserves** are protected areas that are zoned for the protection of biodiversity, geological and geomorphological features. Anthropogenic impacts are controlled through strict conservation measures and values. Strict nature reserves can serve as reference areas for scientific research and monitoring. 
- **Protected areas with sustainable use of natural resources** are used to conserve ecosystems and habitats in addition to cultural values. Although most of the protected area is preserved in its natural condition, low-level non-industrial use is permitted. 
- **Protected landscape/seascapes** are areas where the ecological, biological, cultural, and scenic values have been shaped by the interaction of people and nature over time. Safeguarding this interaction is therefore vital to protecting and conserving the ecological integrity and value of the area. 
- **National parks** are large natural or near natural areas that are designated to protect large-scale ecological processes and that complement the ecosystem characteristics of an area. [^3]

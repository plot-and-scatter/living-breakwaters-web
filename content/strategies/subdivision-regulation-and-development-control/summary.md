A subdivision regulation is a planning tool that can be used to establish conditions for the protection against environmental hazards, e.g., coastal hazards related to sea-level rise.[^1] A subdivision is defined as a separate title of land (bare land strata lot, strata unit, townhouse, row house, or a condominium unit).[^2] The tool works in conjunction with zoning where the administrative responsibility of the subdivision of land is usually given to an Approving Officer who has the power to refuse or approve a subdivision plan.[^3] Subdivision regulation can be complementary to other development control measures. For example, development agreements may require a development to conform to design criteria to ensure public safety. Additionally, development agreements may require developers to demonstrate that a project is not harmful to ecologically sensitive areas.[^5]

### Torontoâ€™s Green Standard 
#### Toronto, Ontario, Canada

The Toronto green standards outline a set of measures to regulate the site and building design, energy and water efficiency, ecological services and solid waste management, and air and water quality. The standards work in tandem with existing development approvals and processes for inspection. The green standards apply to subdivision and site controls for new development related to zoning amendments. The Toronto green standards are useful tools for addressing climate change concerns in the city of Toronto. For example, the standards mandate that new developments retain no less than 5 mm of rainwater for reuse. This helps to reduce stormwater runoff. [^5]

- **A spur dike** is an elongated structure with one end on a bank of a stream and the other end projecting into the water. Spur dikes have been used widely for the protection of stream banks against erosion. They have also been used for the enhancement of aquatic habitats by creating stable pools in disturbed unstable streams. [^10]
- **A debris basin** consists of an earth dam and a barrier constructed across a drainage way or other suitable location to collect sediment. Excess runoff from the dam occurs through spillways. Small pools of water flow through a sediment basin which captures and discharges runoff from adjacent lands. This allows larger silt particles to drop out into the pool. [^11]
- **Check dams** also referred to as ditch checks, dikes, and wattles, may be temporary or permanent linear structures that are installed in a perpendicular position to the flows emanating from drainage ditches, channels, and swales. Check dams help to reduce flow velocity and prevent the down-cutting of channels [^12]
- **Longitudinal stone toe** is an alternative form of a windrow revetment where stones are placed along the existing streambed rather than on top of a bank. “The longitudinal stone toe is laced with a crown well below the top bank, either against the eroding bank line or a distance riverward of the high bank.” [^13]

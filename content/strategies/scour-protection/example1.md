### Gulf of Mexico Wave Protection
#### Franklin County FL, USA

Along State Route 30/US 98 Coastline, beach erosion has been a major problem for more than 30 years.[^4] The highway is adjacent to the coastline and coastal erosion continues to destabilize the roadway. In response, the County decided to construct a revetment system along the coastline using a Contech ArmorFlex revetment system.[^5] The ArmorFlex revetment system features interlocking blocks with a high unit weight that can withstand wave action and a porous system that promotes vegetation and habitat enhancement.[^6]

Scours are property-specific structural tools that are used to protect shoreline structures or building foundations from exposure to the corrosive effects of moving water. Scour protection is typically constructed from riprap or other types of material. The material is applied around the foundation of a structure to prevent erosion from wave action.[^1] Scours are commonly used in protecting the bases of bridge foundations, seawalls, coastlines near highways, rails, or pipelines.[^2] The strategy has limited protection as it only minimizes risk directly to the foundation of buildings and structures.[^3]

- Longitudinal stones help to preserve significant amounts of the existing vegetation on a bank slope. It also encourages the growth of additional vegetation when the bank slope is stabilized. [^14]
- The cost of protecting local scours is low. The maintenance requirements are also low.  Additionally, local scours are relatively easy to construct and adjust to minor scouring.  [^15]
- Check dams help to promote infiltration which results in a reduction in channel erosion. Check dams also serve as traps for coarse sediments. [^17]
- Check dams can reduce peak stormwater runoff.       
- Scour protection with lower levels of invert can improve discharge and reduce flooding levels.

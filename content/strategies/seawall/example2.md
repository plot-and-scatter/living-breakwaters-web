### Stanley Park Seawall 
#### Vancouver BC, Canada

The Stanley Park Seawall is one of the most popular landmarks in Vancouver. It is part of the waterfront path that connects Stanley Park, False Creek, and the Spanish Banks. The construction of the Seawall began in 1917 and was completed in 1980.[^4] After 1980, the Seawall continued to expand outside of Stanley Park. The Seawall near Second Beach and Sunset Beach was upgraded in 2010 and 2011 to address the erosion concerns that were caused by stroms.[^5]

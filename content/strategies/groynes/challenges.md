- Provides limited protection against extreme storm events
- Reduces transport of sediments down the coastline
- Causes downdrift erosion
- Complementary to artificial nourishment, e.g., could reduce positive impacts on coastlines down-drift
- Rip currents may occur adjacent to groynes presenting hazards to bathers and other users
- May lead to sediment loss during storm events 
- May negatively impact coastline appearance, given its unnatural, shore perpendicular structure [^14]

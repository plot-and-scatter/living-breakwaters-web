Groynes are rigid structures, typically constructed using heavy materials extending from the upper shore to the water.[^1] They are used in combination with beach nourishment by trapping beach material that is transported during high wave conditions.[^2] Groynes can be constructed using various materials including timber, steel, concrete to rubble-mounds. Each material has different strengths and weaknesses and life expectancies. Long-term maintenance is required, and the replacement of groynes are common in flood management plans. As a response to downdrift erosion construction of groynes should be accompanied by a regular recycling or nourishment program.[^3]

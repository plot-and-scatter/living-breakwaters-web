### Beach Groynes
#### Surrey BC, Canada

Coastal erosion has been a problem at Crescent Beach since 1914, in response, a timber groyne system was implemented along the West Beach.[^8] The groyne system helps to protect the beach from further erosion and the existing dike.[^9] In 1999, an assessment was done to identify the causes of shoreline erosion that was observed years after the construction of the groynes.[^10] The study showed that the cause of shoreline erosion was due to the decrease in sediment supply, sediment transport, damaged groynes, and frequent storm events.[^11] Since 2001, remediation of the beach was undertaken including the repair and replacement of the groynes and a recommendation for beach nourishment.[^12]

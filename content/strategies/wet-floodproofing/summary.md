Wet floodproofing is the measure of allowing water to enter and exit a structure with minimal or no damage. Wet floodproofing includes a suite of measures including the use of flood-resistant materials, below the Base Flood Elevation (BFE), elevation of electrical and mechanical services, openings that allow drainage from the inside of the building to the outside, and breakaway walls. The applicability of wet floodproofing is limited, however, in small residential properties, it can be a viable alternative compared to elevation.[^1] The strategic placement of openings allows for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure so that water can flow in and out.[^2]

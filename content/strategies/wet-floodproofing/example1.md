### The National Flood Insurance Programme 
#### USA

The National Flood Insurance Programme (NFIP) guarantees flood insurance to communities that regulate and ensure that floodplain development meets certain criteria.[^3] One of the criterion that the NFIP requires is that all new non-residential developments are flood-proofed.[^4] The design of a building that is below flood elevation must have watertight walls, structural components that can resist hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads, and utilities that are protected from flood damage.[^5] Also, NFIP requires that flood-resistant materials must be used in parts of the build that are exposed to floodwater.[^6]

### Spray-and-wash Basement
#### Calgary AB, Canada

In Calgary, homeowners renovate their basements with flood-resistant materials. The renovation required the existing basement to be gutted and replaced with materials such as steel stairs, polished concrete floors, and walls that are impervious to water.[^7] The renovation materials cost about 30 percent more than the conventional building materials.[^8] The use of water-resistant material allows for post-flood cleanup to be much faster and less costly.

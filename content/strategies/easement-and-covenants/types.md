- **Conservation easements** are legal agreements that are registered on the title between a landowner and a qualified organization, e.g., a conservation organization, land trust, or government agency. The easements provide long-term protection for the property. Some conservation easements may provide protection for as much as 999 years. [^12]
- **Property easements of prescription** apply to rights that have been enjoyed for 20 years without interruption or consent by a servient landowner. However, specific requirements must be met before property easement rights can be enjoyed. For example, if the property owner provides the user with permission every 20 years, easement by prescription does not arise. 
- **An express grant** means that a right of way has been expressly granted and that the right will be registered on the title in a land registry. Express grants typically apply where the owner of a servient property grants an easement for the benefit of one or more properties 
- **An implied grant** is a legal document that provides for the establishment of an easement when it is necessary for the use and enjoyment of property. For example, if a property owner severs a lot but does not register an easement for access and the lot that is severed is landlocked. [^13],[^14]

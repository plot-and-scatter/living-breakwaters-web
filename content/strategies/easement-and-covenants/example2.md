### Texas Open Beaches Act 
#### TX, USA

In 1959, the Texas Open Beaches Act (TOBA) was passed to maintain public access along the Gulf shores through a rolling easement concept.[^8] In the TOBA, a rolling easement is defined as the area between the vegetation line and the mean low tide line. Therefore, public access to beaches is not static.[^9] Like many other rolling easements, the TOBA prohibits property owners from using hard shoreline protection that would impede public access to a beach.[^10] Ownership of property does not change with the TOBA; however, it requires landowners to protect the public’s right of access.[^11] The rolling easement is critical to the migration of the Gulf’s coastal wetlands which provides a habitat for many endangered species.

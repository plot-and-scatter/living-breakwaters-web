### Coastal South Carolina Rolling Easement 
#### SC, USA

Along the coast of South Carolina, a rolling easement system was implemented on the seaward side of the setback line using the Beach Front Management Act in 1990.[^5] A rolling easement typically rolls landward to allow for the migration of coastal vegetation. Thus, it restricts property owners from using hard shoreline protection.[^6] The easement line is defined by the new vegetation line.[^7] This tool has been implemented across several coastal communities in the United States.

An easement or covenant is a legal agreement that allows the owner of a parcel of land to grant rights to others for a designated use.[^1] In Canada, except for Quebec, covenants and easements are authorized by either common law or statute. [^16] Easements grant the right of access to a passageway through a property.[^3] In common law, an easement is attached to the land that benefits from the easement. Hence, the easement belongs to who owns the land. [^16] Easements and covenants can serve as important strategies in climate change adaptation planning. For example, as an avoidance measure, a municipality may acquire a conservation easement to inhibit development in coastal areas that are susceptible to sea-level rise and flooding due to storm surges. Additionally, a covenant can be negotiated with landowners to prevent the construction of hard structures such as docks and sea walls that can prevent the migration of marshes and dunes inland. [^5]

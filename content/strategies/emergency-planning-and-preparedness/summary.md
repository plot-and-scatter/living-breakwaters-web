Emergency planning and preparedness is a coordinated process that involves assessing the likely impacts of a disaster event and coordinating a set of responses to reduce or prevent property damage. Planning approaches such as evacuation routes and plans, emergency management plans, tsunami response plans can be implemented before a disaster to reduce the damage to property, infrastructure, economy, and transportation.[^1] Preparing for coastal hazards allows local governments to declare a local emergency in the face of a storm surge.[^2] The effectiveness of emergency plans is determined by the level of commitment and resources allocated and requires regular updates over time.[^3]

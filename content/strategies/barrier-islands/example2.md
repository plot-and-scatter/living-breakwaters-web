### Mississippi Coastal Improvements Program
#### MS, USA

The Mississippi Coastal Improvements Program is a large-scale barrier island restoration project intended to restore and protect the Gulf Islands National Seashore barrier islands.[^5] The project began in 2007 with the assistance of the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and other agencies. The project focuses on the re-nourishment of several islands and the restoration of natural sediment transport.[^6] The dredging and nourishment cost is estimated to be approximately \$368 million and requires about 14.5 million cubic meters of sediment.[^7] Ongoing monitoring by the National Park Service keeps track of the success of the project focusing on sand accretion, restoration of natural transport processes, and protection of cultural resources.[^8]

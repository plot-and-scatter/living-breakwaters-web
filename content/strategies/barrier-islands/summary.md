Located offshore, barrier islands are dynamic landforms that are formed from offshore bars and, spits. Barrier islands undergo continuous migration through a process of erosion and accretion.[^1] [^2] Given the migratory process through which they derive their structure, hard approaches to coastal protection tend to disrupt the formation of barrier islands. Barrier islands have been protected for decades in some areas, e.g., Miami. However, impending SLR could lead to the abandonment of barrier islands as a retreat strategy.[^2] Barrier islands can be both inhabited or uninhabited. They evolve over time with coastal processes, to form several unique ecosystems, including subaerial beaches, dune fields, interior wetlands, and back-barrier bays or wetlands. These ecosystems provide habitat for a wide range of plants and marine species.

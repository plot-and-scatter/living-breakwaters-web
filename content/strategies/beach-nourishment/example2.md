### Parlee Beach Nourishment Program 
#### Pointe-Du-Chene NB, Canada [^5]

The beach nourishment program at Parlee Beach is part of an ongoing management program that uses a portion of the park entrance fee as funding for beach nourishment.[^5] In addition to mitigating the impacts of storms, the beach nourishment, and associated maintenance and management aims to promote vegetative growth to stabilize dunes. In this way, beach nourishment provides a habitat for marine animals as well as a recreation area for visitors. The volume of sand that is added to the beach varies from year to year. The amount of nourishment required is determined by an annual assessment. The assessment determines the amount of sand lost from storm damage from the previous year.[^6] As is the case with most beach nourishment programs; the source and match of beach sediment is a challenge. However, with the Parlee Beach Nourishment Program, the material is obtained through land-based processes from sand collected north of the beach.[^7] Because the harvested sand shares the same characteristics as the local beach sand, it functions similarly and retains the same aesthetics.

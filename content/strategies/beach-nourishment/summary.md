Beach nourishment (beach renourishment, beach replenishment, or sand replenishment) involves a process of replacing material (usually sand) to a beach that might have been lost by longshore drift or erosion.[^1] Beach sediment is usually sourced from off-shore dredging and pumped onto the beach area where it is dispersed naturally or mechanically. This increases beach elevation and width. Beach nourishment helps to dissipate wave energy: the wider the beach, the more energy is dissipated.[^2] Artificial beach nourishment is a long-term maintenance effort. The volume and frequency of fill used will change over time based on the impacts of drivers such as sea-level rise, and other erosive effects along a shoreline. Long-term artificial beach nourishment requires on-going monitoring, funding, and maintenance programs to be successful.[^2]

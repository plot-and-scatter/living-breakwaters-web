### Sand Engine 
#### The Hague, The Netherlands [^4]

The Sand Engine (or Sand Motor) is a unique beach nourishment experiment in using coastal processes (wind, waves, currents) to replenish a section of the Dutch coast over time. This project seeks to prevent flooding by building with nature. During construction, 21.5 million cubic meters of sand dredged 10 kilometers off the coast, was used to create a hook-shaped peninsula.[^3] Coastal geomorphological processes have since moved significant amounts of the sediment both to the north and south of the Sand Engine.[^4] This process has created 3,500 acres of new beach and dune. Ongoing monitoring and data collection contribute to tracking geomorphological processes in response to storms and currents. This data will be used to predict behavior, and to determine if sand engines can be used elsewhere. In addition to beach nourishment, the Sand Engine is creating new habitat for flora and fauna, as well as recreational areas for visitors.

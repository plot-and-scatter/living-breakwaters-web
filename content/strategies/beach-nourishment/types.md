- **Backshore nourishment** involves the strengthening of the backshore at the foot of a dune to reinforce the upper portion of a beach. This is done to strengthen the dune against erosion and breaches during an extreme event. Materials are built up at the front of the dune as a buffer. However, this material may be eroded during an extreme event. [^11] [^12]
- **Shoreface nourishment** is generally used in coastal areas where protection measures have resulted in the steepening of the profile of the shoreline leading to long-term sediment deficit. It involves building up the shoreface, i.e., â€œthe area between the mean low water mark and the fair-weather wave base.'' This leads to the reduction of waves which enhances the accumulation of beach material. [^11] [^12]
- **Veneer fill** involves placing beach-quality sands over material that is generally unsuitable for beach nourishment. The unsuitable materials (grossly coarser or finer than normal beach sand), forms the sublayer beneath a thin surface sand veneer. [^13]
- **Beach and surf zones** are created by depositing sand high up the beach. The sand deposits are protected using revetments, groynes, detached breakwaters, and submerged sills.

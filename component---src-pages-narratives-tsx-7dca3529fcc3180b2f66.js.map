This gives us a very fast way of looking up a progress position rather than looping through all the points/Beziers. You can optionally have it only measure a subset, starting at startIndex and going for a specific number of beziers (remember, there are 3 x/y pairs each, for a total of 6 elements for each Bezier). It will also populate a \"totalLength\" property, but that's not generally super accurate because by default it'll only take 6 samples per Bezier. But for performance reasons, it's perfectly adequate for measuring progress values along the path.

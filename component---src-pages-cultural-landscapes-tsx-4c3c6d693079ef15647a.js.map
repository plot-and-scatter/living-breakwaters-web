This estuary\n            habitat and its food web also support important fishes, including\n            for hundreds of millions of out-migrating juvenile salmon each year\n            that come from throughout the vast Fraser River watershed. The\n            region also provides key habitat for white sturgeon, one of the\n            largest freshwater fish in the world, and Pacific herring, which are\n            a foundational part of the coastal food web. Moreover, these fish\n            are tied to both Indigenous food sovereignty and ways of life. With\n            most of the existing coastline fixed behind hard infrastructures\n            (e.g., dikes and seawalls), coastal ecosystems in the region cannot\n            migrate with rising sea levels. A lack of sediment and other factors\n            further exacerbate this problem. Over the course of the 20th\n            century, dredging (for navigation) and the construction of many\n            jetties and breakwaters have significantly altered sedimentation\n            patterns. Without any adaptation, these expansive habitats will\n            likely disappear in certain locations by the end of the century.\n          </>\n        }\n        intro={\n          <>\n            As an interface between human and natural systems, infrastructures\n            networks underpin the form and functioning of the built environment.\n            As such, a failure in an infrastructure system can have cascading\n            effects and impact ecosystems as well as city-wide water, energy,\n            food, waste management, and transportation service provision.

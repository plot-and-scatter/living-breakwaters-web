In addition to SLR and other effects of climate change, coastal areas are also confronted with the challenge of ongoing population growth, aging infrastructure, and declines in coastal social and ecological systems occasioned by interruptions in coastal geomorphological processes. Imagining alternative futures for coastal cities will require coastal planning strategies that are focused on the opportunities for adaptation to changes affecting coastal systems using environmentally sensitive design and engineered solutions that promote more resilient coastal urban landscapes.
